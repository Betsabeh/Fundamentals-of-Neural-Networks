## Description

This teaching package contains modular contents for the introduction of the fundamentals of Neural Networks. The package consists of a series of MATLAB [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) with complementary PowerPoint presentations. 
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/matlab) is a programming and numeric computing platform developed by [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/company).

The package is intended to gradually guide the students toward basic concepts in neural networks through general demonstrations applicable to every field, spanning from science to engineering. The materials also include a classical engineering problem, namely industrial diagnostics of compressor connection rod defects.

The contents are mainly addressed towards undergraduate courses, however, the modular structure allows further integration within other (postgraduate) AI-based courses. Course application areas include Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Industrial diagnostics and Condition Monitoring, and Autonomous Systems.

## Instructions

The teaching materials can be approached either by following the Live Scripts or the PowerPoint presentations. Open the introductory live script [NN0b\_Contents\_and\_instructions.mlx](NN0%20-%20Contents/NN0b_Contents_and_instructions.mlx) or the introductory presentation [NN0a\_Contents\_and\_instructions.pptx](NN0%20-%20Contents//NN0a_Contents_and_instructions.pptx) and follow the presentation.

### Live Scripts

The instructions inside the Live Scripts will guide you through the activities and exercises. We suggest running each section within a Live Script individually. 
Interactive Live Script controls(sliders, checkboxes, buttons, etc.) invite you to experiment with various parameter configurations. See also the introductory video on [How to use Live Script Controls](https://www.mathworks.com/support/search.html/videos/how-to-use-live-editor-controls-1569868241587.html).
Each Live Script also contains a link to the complementary PowerPoint presentation.

### PowerPoint presentations

The teaching can also be approached by following the PowerPoint presentations. In this case, each presentation will provide links to the complementary Live Script examples.
